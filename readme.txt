A unique plugin that combines analytics with pop-up offers so you can directly make your top visitors specialized offers they just canâ€™t refuse

== Description ==

Stealthlead increases your online store sales.

If you run an eCommerce site then you know that every sale is crucial. Each lost sale means wasted marketing dollars that you paid for to bring that sales lead to your site.

Stealthlead does just one simple thing - which is to send you a daily email about your top visitors and their top viewed products, so you can easily make personalised pop-up offers via that same email.

There are no analytics graphs and charts or complicated numbers or words. There isn't even a dashboard. Just your daily top leads to your email inbox that lets you close the sale via mobile, tablet or desktop.
